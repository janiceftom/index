<!--Boilerplate: Every webpage includes: doctype tag, html element, a head element, a title element, a body element-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<!--The Head Element - contains information about the page, but does not display content-->

<head>
	<title>Home</title>
	<!--The charset attritute is to define the version of Unicorde that we are using and the UTF-8 is the commond standard for handling the characters used in the world's writing systems - the charset and UTF-8 MUST always be included in the <head> to avoid character display issues.-->
