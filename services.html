      <h3>Environmental Monitoring, Environmental Impact Studies and Historical sites</h3>
      <p>Environmental Monitoring is required by contractors that work within the traditional territories of each nation. The Environmental Monitor is hired by Traditional Land Use Manager - to monitor Archeologists anything that is overlooked the Environmental Monitor reports to the Senior Archeologists where an Environmental Impact Study may take place. The Environmental Study will see what is there, look for artifacts and if there is findings on the site, the work site is shut down.
      The Head Archeologists from Vancouver, Calgary or Toronto are called in for a refined study. The Head Archeologist marks out the area with stakes with ribbons on it and they will start to dig there. The time for each of the studies depends on
      the number of stakes put out, the Head Archeologist will complete digs where each stake is. The Archeologists put all their findings together and if there is sufficient data found the contractor is required to stop the job until the refined
      study is complete.
<br>
<br>
      If the contractor is told that they are unable to do work in a study area they will put up a boundary or buffer around the study area. Then the environmental monitoring starts again.
<br>
<br>
      After a complete refined search is complete, and there is sufficient findings, the archeologists may then declare the site an historical site. The Environmental Monitors stay onsite to act as an advisor.

      <h2>G.I.S. and Traditional Land Use Studies</h2>
      <p>Geographic Information Systems compliments Traditional Land Use Studies in that the projects can incorporate traditional with scientific knowledge in forest
      management planning.
<br>
<br>
        G.I.S. and Traditional Land Use and Research are beneficial to the projects as all of the information can be displayed digitally, or in hard copy (printed) this can also allow for protection of our land and our Tmixw.
